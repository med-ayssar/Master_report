\label{chap:jit}

The focus of this chapter is on concepts for the integration of \emph{just-in-time} (\emph{JIT}) compilation for NESTML models into the PyNEST workflow in a way that is fully backwards compatible and does not require any changes to the PyNEST API. As in any software development process, we start by listing the requirements that the JIT mechanism must fulfil. We then discuss different aspects of our design decisions and finally show what possible implications the new software layer will actually have on simulation scripts.

\section{Functional requirements}

In order to have a concise understanding of the JIT mechanism and to really evaluate the correctness of the chosen design, we need a list of requirements that should facilitate the communication between the JIT mechanism and PyNEST and cover the different scenarios that may occur during the simulation.

First and foremost, the JIT mechanism should interact with the PyNEST module and the simulation script. This interaction puts certain restrictions on the functionality of the JIT compilation and affects the structure of simulation scripts and how PyNEST interacts with models. In the following sections, we thus list the most important requirements and explain them in detail. We start with requirements coming from the simulation script and continue with those from the PyNEST module.

\subsection*{Simulation script requirements}

\begin{labeling}{alligator}
   \item[/F1/] The user script should not explicitly import the \emph{PyNESTML} module.
   \item[/F2/] Enabling and disabling the JIT mechanism must be possible in a straightforward way.
   \item[/F3/] Having JIT compilation enabled, the simulation script should not differ a lot from the original script.
   \item[/F4/]\label{req:F4} The user should not explicitly specify the name of the neuron/synapse pairs when connecting the network elements.
   \item[/F5/] A model instance should be available after the call to \texttt{Create()}.
\end{labeling}

These five requirements constitute the basic specifications for designing the JIT mechanism. The first requirement states that the user should not explicitly import the \emph{PyNESTML} module in the script, and thus the JIT mechanism itself will decide if the code generator is required or not, or at which point in time it will import it. The second requirement requires that enabling or disabling the JIT mechanism must not be a complex process. The best way to fulfill this is to only have a single a call in Python without any further user interaction. The third requirement ensures that there is no huge deviation between a script that has the JIT mechanism enabled and one that has it disabled. The fourth requirement addresses the problem that when co-generating a neuron together with a synapse model, the names of both will be changed and the user has to manually use the new names when establishing connections that involve the co-generated models. Retrieving information about the model instances or setting their attributes after creation is very common in most of the simulation scripts, and must be granted to fulfill the sixth requirement, which states that the model should be available right after calling the \texttt{Create()} function.

\subsection*{PyNEST module requirements}

\begin{labeling}{alligator}
   \item[/F7/] Running the simulation with or without the JIT mechanism should not affect the network behavior.
   \item[/F8/] The JIT mechanism should not affect the workflow of PyNEST.
   \item[/F9/] Function signatures of the PyNEST high-level API should not be changed when using the JIT mechanism.
\end{labeling}

When creating instances of the model, the user can parametrize it using values drawn from a specified random distribution. When running the simulation script with the JIT mechanism enabled, the result must be correct and \emph{reproducible}. The seventh requirement thus ensures the correctness of the JIT module. The eighth requirement emphasizes that PyNEST should be completely independent and unaware of the existence of the JIT module, while the last requirement is postulates that the signatures of PyNEST API functions should not be changed in order to ease the implementation of the JIT mechanism.

Based on these requirements coming from the user level simulation script and the PyNEST module, we have designed two complementary approaches that would satisfy all requirements. The benefits and drawbacks of the two designs will be discussed in the following section.

\section{Approach 1: Static code analysis}

The first design idea was to create a \emph{static code analysis} tool that would examine the simulation script before actually running it. The tool would analyze the script against a set of defined rules and decide if the code requires a rearrangement of function calls in PyNEST. In addition, it would extract the parameters of the \texttt{Create()} and \texttt{Connect()} function calls and predict the expected amount of memory needed, so that the required storage could be allocated before actually creating the nodes.

    \caption{\textbf{The execution flow of any possible simulation}: All simulations start by creating an arbitrary number of nodes as instances of the registered models. Model attributes can be either assigned deterministic or random values. If random values are used, the user can inspect the drawn values and check the current state of the nodes before building the network. Similarly to the nodes, creating the network by connecting the nodes can be either be a fully deterministic or a random operation (in both the connection parameters and the connectivity itself). The user can inspect the topology of the network before running the simulation. Both, the network and the nodes might have different states after running the simulation, and those states might be inspected after the simulation to draw conclusions about the behavior of the network and its nodes.}

Unfortunately, this two-pass approach suffers from a severe problem: Simulation scripts can be split into different phases, as depicted in \autoref{fig:simulation_steps}. Usually they start by creating instances of arbitrary models (the \emph{nodes}) and the user may then modify the parameters of these nodes. In case of parameters drawn from a random distribution, the user may want to inspect the chosen values before connecting the nodes to create the network. Similarly, the parameters of the edges of the network (i.e., the \emph{synapses}) may be assigned randomized values that the user might want to inspect prior to the simulation. Due to the static nature of the proposed tool, it cannot take into account all possible ways a user may modify neuronal or synaptic properties after their creation, and thus the tool would not be very flexible.

Rearranging the script to allow for more user flexibility would violate the requirement that the simulation script must not be changed and results must be \emph{reproducible} (\emph{F7}). It may simply not always be possible to control the order of the creation of nodes when function calls get rearranged, which might introduce slight deviations in the script and therefore in the simulation results with the code analysis in place compared to the original simulation script without.

The tool also violates \emph{F4}, as we cannot tell if the \emph{synapse} type involved in creating the connection is a \emph{built-in} synapse or a custom defined synapse just by performing a purely static analysis. This would result in a situation, where the user still has to explicitly provide the name of the \emph{synapse} model coming from the code generator.

To prevent the violation of the requirements mentioned above, the logic of the simulation script could be split into two parts: The first part for the functionalities that do not require the analysis tool, the second for those that do. However, even if we would find a solution to this partition problem, it is obvious that we are again rearranging the code and end up violating the requirements \emph{F8} (reproducibility) and \emph{F3} (deviation from original code).

As the static analysis violates some crucial requirements for preserving the correctness of simulations, we have come up with an alternative approach that should solve the problems of the static analysis tool.


\section{Approach 2: PyNEST Wrapper}

As shown in \autoref{fig:simulation_steps} all simulation scripts other than those simulating an empty network or a network with only a single node contain at least two essential functions, namely \texttt{Create()} and \texttt{Connect()}. The first takes four parameters: the model name, the number of instances to be created, the instance parameters and a spatial arrangement for the instances. In this section, we are only interested in the first parameter, the model name. After installing a new external model, the NestKernel stores it in an array of models. When creating a new instance of the model, the NestKernel searches for the model by its name and once it is found, it creates the required number of instances. A precondition for the \texttt{Create()} function to work is thus to have the models installed and registered in the NestKernel.

The second function that is present in all non-trivial simulation scripts is \texttt{Connect()}. Its five parameters are The source nodes, the target nodes, a dictionary specifying the connection pattern to establish between source and target population, a dictionary for specifying the synapse model and its parameters, and finally a Boolean indicating if the function should return a \texttt{SynapseCollection} object to inspect the created connections. When using both external neuron and synapse models in the connection, the user must explicitly co-generate the neuron and synapse models, providing a mapping between neuronal and synaptic variables (called \emph{port map}) to the code generator before installing them.

The idea of the second approach is to create an interface that controls the NESTML workflow behind the scenes of PyNEST function calls. It is clear that the model's name is sufficient to locate the model, either as in the \texttt{.nestml} file or in the dynamic library. Depending on the situation, we can then either install the module directly or first generate the model's code, build it and then install it. With this new setup, the user can then stop importing the PyNESTML module and explicitly calling the \texttt{Install()} function, as both will be handled transparently in the background when calling the \texttt{Create()} function. Again, it is important to understand that we are not modifying the PyNEST module, we are simply implementing an intermediate interface between the simulation script and the real PyNEST functions, and this new interface would provide the same functions to the simulation script.

This approach works as a \emph{wrapper} around all of PyNEST, so we do not need to have a wrapper around each PyNEST function. It suffices to only choose those \emph{high-level API} functions and intercept their calls and decide either to execute them directly, or apply some logic before and after the real function calls or even disable them altogether. Mathematically described, each function $f$ in PyNEST is replaced by one of the following execution paths:

\begin{align*}
f \mapsto&\enspace\emptyset\\
f \mapsto&\enspace f \circ before \\
f \mapsto&\enspace f \\
f \mapsto&\enspace after \circ f \\
f \mapsto&\enspace after \circ f \circ before\\
f \mapsto&\enspace g:\enspace \text{\#replace the call of } f \text{ with } g \in \{before, after\}  \\
\end{align*}

The empty set ($\emptyset$) means that we intercept the function call, but do nothing (the function will be disabled). The functions \texttt{before} and \texttt{after} represent pre-processing and post-processing steps. For example, when creating instances of the model, the \texttt{before} function could search for the model and ensure that the real \texttt{Create()} function will be called without errors. The \texttt{after} function would return the \emph{NodeCollection} object containing the instances of the model. In this scenario, the real \texttt{Create()} would be called inside the \texttt{before} function.

One remaining issue is concerning calls to \texttt{Connect()} and the co-generation of neuron/synapse pairs. Recall that the user must explicitly specify the port connecting both the neuron and the synapse, and this information is handled by the code generator. To tackle this issue and completely remove the use of the code generator in the simulation script, we would have to extend the synapse dictionary object in the \texttt{Connect()} function with a new key referring to the mapping between the neuron and synapse and let the \texttt{before} function processes the dictionary and remove the inserted key before it forwards it to the code generator. Once the co-generation is finished, we can then call the real \emph{Connect()} function in PyNEST.

This approach might sound simple at first glance, but a lot has to happen behind the scene, as new components are introduced that facilitate the interception of PyNEST functions calls. All required components are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections by introducing their roles and how they can be used and how they ensure the fulfillment of all functional requirements as laid out above.
